# Heat Mapping Project

This is a Python-based project to capture temperature and humidity data using a Raspberry Pi. This repo includes the main script for data capture, setup instructions, and test scripts for development and debugging.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start
Assuming you have a Raspberry Pi all set up...
### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/heat-project.git
cd heat-project
```
### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
After you activate your virtual environment you should notice `(env)` in your console. Keep it activated now, but if you want, you can deactivate your virtual environment by running `deactivate`.

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the data capture script
```bash
python src/capture_data.py
```

## ðŸ›  Hardware Setup
