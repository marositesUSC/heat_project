If you chose to create the directory from scratch. You will follow these instructions. 

### Create our directory
Find a specific place where you want to create your own directory for our project. Use the `mkdir` command to create your `heat_project` folder. 

```bash
mkdir heat_project
```
Create a virtual environment.
```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

This will take a minute, but will create a new virtual environment (env), or container, to store python packages. If you run the command ls you will see a new folder called env.

You can activate your virtual env by running the command

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

You will notice your environment out infront of your user@sensorname:

You can deactivate the virtual environment by running the command `deactive` in the terminal, but keep it **activate** for now.
